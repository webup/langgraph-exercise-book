    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[llms.txt](https://llmstxt.org/) is a website index for LLMs, providing background information, guidance, and links to detailed markdown files. IDEs like Cursor and Windsurf or apps like Claude Code/Desktop can use `llms.txt` to retrieve context for tasks. However, these apps use different built-in tools to read and process files like `llms.txt`. The retrieval process can be opaque, and there is not always a way to audit the tool calls or the context returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "[MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) offers a way for developers to have *full control* over tools used by these applications. Here, we create [an open source MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) to provide MCP host applications (e.g., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code/Desktop) with (1) a user-defined list of `llms.txt` files and (2) a simple  `fetch_docs` tool read URLs within any of the provided `llms.txt` files. This allows the user to audit each tool call as well as the context returned. \n",

    "> 1. **Remote llms.txt files**: When you specify a remote llms.txt URL (e.g., `https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/llms.txt`), mcpdoc automatically adds only that specific domain (`langchain-ai.github.io`) to the allowed domains list. This means the tool can only fetch documentation from URLs on that domain.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 2. **Local llms.txt files**: When using a local file, NO domains are automatically added to the allowed list. You MUST explicitly specify which domains to allow using the `--allowed-domains` parameter.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 3. **Adding additional domains**: To allow fetching from domains beyond those automatically included:\n",
    ">    - Use `--allowed-domains domain1.com domain2.com` to add specific domains\n",
    ">    - Use `--allowed-domains '*'` to allow all domains (use with caution)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> This security measure prevents unauthorized access to domains not explicitly approved by the user, ensuring that documentation can only be retrieved from trusted sources.]\n",

    "> This command starts the MCP documentation server with the following parameters:\n",
    "> - `--from mcpdoc mcpdoc`: Installs and runs the mcpdoc package\n",
