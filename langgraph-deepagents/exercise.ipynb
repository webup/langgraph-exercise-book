    "# ðŸ§ ðŸ¤– Deep Agents with LangGraph\n",
    "\n",
    "Using an LLM to call tools in a loop is the simplest form of an agent. This architecture, however, can yield agents that are \"shallow\" and fail to plan and act over longer, more complex tasks. Applications like \"Deep Research\", \"Manus\", and \"Claude Code\" have gotten around this limitation by implementing a combination of four things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Planning tool** - helps agents structure complex tasks\n",
    "- **Sub agents** - specialized agents for specific tasks  \n",
    "- **File system** - persistent workspace for intermediate results\n",
    "- **Detailed prompt** - comprehensive instructions for deep reasoning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the `deepagents` library which implements these patterns in a general purpose way, allowing you to easily create Deep Agents for your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Makes an Agent \"Deep\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep agents differ from simple tool-calling agents in several key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Planning Capability** - Can break down complex tasks into subtasks\n",
    "2. **Context Quarantine** - Uses sub-agents to avoid context pollution\n",
    "3. **Persistent Workspace** - Maintains state across multiple interactions\n",
    "4. **Specialized Instructions** - Detailed prompts for specific domains\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we'll build a deep research agent that can conduct thorough investigations and produce comprehensive reports."

      "# LangGraph: A Comprehensive Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "## Definition and Core Concept\n",
      "\n",
      "**LangGraph** is an open-source AI agent framework developed by LangChain that provides a graph-based architecture for building, deploying, and managing complex generative AI agent workflows. At its fundamental level, LangGraph is a message-passing framework that enables the creation of modular, stateful systems where multiple AI agents can coordinate and collaborate to accomplish sophisticated tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike traditional linear programming approaches, LangGraph models AI workflows as **directed graphs** consisting of:\n",
      "- **Nodes**: Individual components, agents, or functions that perform specific tasks\n",
      "- **Edges**: Connections that define the flow of execution and data between nodes\n",
      "- **State**: A shared memory system that persists information across the entire workflow\n",
      "\n",
      "## Purpose and Core Problems Solved\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. **Stateful Multi-Agent Coordination**\n",
      "LangGraph addresses the challenge of building AI systems where multiple agents need to work together while maintaining context and memory across interactions. Traditional approaches struggle with coordinating multiple AI agents that need to share information and build upon each other's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. **Complex Workflow Management**\n",
      "The framework solves the problem of managing intricate AI workflows that require:\n",
      "- Cyclical execution patterns (loops and iterations)\n",
      "- Conditional branching based on AI decision-making\n",
      "- Dynamic routing where the AI determines the next step\n",
      "- Long-running processes that need to maintain state\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. **Beyond Linear Chains**\n",
      "While traditional LangChain operates with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that follow a linear sequence, LangGraph explicitly supports loops, branching, and cyclical workflows. This enables true \"agentic state machines\" where an LLM can decide the next node to activate based on current conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 4. **Production-Ready Agent Systems**\n",
      "LangGraph provides enterprise-grade features including:\n",
      "- Persistent state management across sessions\n",
      "- Human-in-the-loop controls and approvals\n",
      "- Real-time streaming of agent reasoning and actions\n",
      "- Reliability and controllability mechanisms\n",
      "- Built-in monitoring and debugging capabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Architectural Components\n",
      "\n",
      "### **State Management**\n",
      "- Uses TypedDict schemas or Pydantic models to define shared state\n",
      "- Implements reducer functions to manage how state updates are applied\n",
      "- Maintains context across long-running workflows\n",
      "- Enables memory persistence between different execution cycles\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Graph Structure**\n",
      "- **StateGraph**: The core graph object that defines the workflow structure\n",
      "- **Nodes**: Python functions or LangChain runnables that process data\n",
      "- **Edges**: Fixed or conditional connections that determine execution flow\n",
      "- **Compilation**: Graphs are compiled into runnable objects supporting `.invoke()`, `.stream()`, and async operations\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Multi-Agent Capabilities**\n",
      "- Supports hierarchical agent architectures\n",
      "- Enables agent handoffs and collaboration\n",
      "- Provides supervisor-subordinate patterns\n",
      "- Allows for team-based agent coordination\n",
      "\n",
      "## What Makes LangGraph Different\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Vs. Traditional LangChain**\n",
      "- **LangChain**: Best for predictable, step-by-step linear processes\n",
      "- **LangGraph**: Handles complex, iterative, and cyclical workflows with sophisticated decision-making\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Advantages**\n",
      "1. **Cyclical Execution**: Unlike DAGs, supports loops and iterative reasoning\n",
      "2. **Dynamic Decision Making**: AI agents can determine workflow paths in real-time\n",
      "3. **Persistent Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions and sessions\n",
      "4. **Modular Architecture**: Enables reusable components and flexible system design\n",
      "5. **Production Features**: Built-in streaming, monitoring, and human oversight capabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "## Use Cases and Applications\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is particularly well-suited for:\n",
      "- **Complex Chatbots**: Multi-turn conversations requiring context and memory\n",
      "- **Multi-Agent Research Systems**: Teams of AI agents collaborating on analysis tasks\n",
      "- **Workflow Automation**: Business processes requiring decision points and iterations\n",
      "- **Customer Support Systems**: Sophisticated routing and escalation mechanisms\n",
      "- **Financial Analysis**: Multi-step analysis with branching logic and collaborative agents\n",
      "- **Content Creation Pipelines**: Multi-stage content development with review cycles\n",
      "\n",
      "## Fundamental Value Proposition\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph represents a paradigm shift from simple chain-based AI applications to sophisticated, stateful agent architectures capable of handling real-world complexity. It provides developers with the tools to build AI systems that can:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Think iteratively** through complex problems\n",
      "- **Maintain context** across extended interactions  \n",
      "- **Coordinate multiple specialized agents** working toward common goals\n",
      "- **Handle uncertainty** through dynamic decision-making\n",
      "- **Scale to production** with enterprise-grade reliability features\n",
      "\n",
      "The framework essentially bridges the gap between simple AI chatbots and complex, production-ready AI agent systems that can handle the nuanced, multi-step reasoning required for sophisticated real-world applications.\n",

      "# LangGraph Technical Architecture: A Deep Dive\n",
      "\n",
      "## 1. Graph Structure: Nodes and Edges\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph models agent workflows as **directed graphs** with cyclical capabilities, fundamentally different from traditional DAG-based frameworks.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Core Components:\n",
      "- **Nodes**: Python functions that encode agent logic, receiving current state as input and returning updated state\n",
      "- **Edges**: Define execution flow and routing between nodes\n",
      "- **StateGraph**: The main graph class parameterized by a user-defined state object\n",
      "\n",
      "### Node Types:\n",
      "- **Regular Nodes**: Standard Python functions (sync/async) with state as first parameter\n",
      "- **START Node**: Special virtual node representing entry point\n",
      "- **END Node**: Terminal node marking execution completion\n",
      "- **Subgraph Nodes**: Entire graphs embedded as nodes for hierarchical architectures\n",
      "\n",
      "### Edge Types:\n",
      "- **Normal Edges**: Direct connections (`graph.add_edge(\"node_a\", \"node_b\")`)\n",
      "- **Conditional Edges**: Dynamic routing based on state evaluation\n",
      "- **Entry Points**: Define starting nodes from START\n",
      "- **Conditional Entry Points**: Dynamic entry point selection\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Model:\n",
      "LangGraph uses a **message-passing algorithm** inspired by Google's Pregel system, executing in discrete \"super-steps\":\n",
      "- Nodes begin in `inactive` state\n",
      "- Become `active` when receiving messages on incoming edges\n",
      "- Execute function and send updates to next nodes\n",
      "- Graph terminates when all nodes are `inactive` with no messages in transit\n",
      "\n",
      "## 2. State Management System\n",
      "\n",
      "### State Schema Definition:\n",
      "State can be defined using `TypedDict` or Pydantic `BaseModel`:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "class State(TypedDict):\n",
      "    messages: Annotated[list[AnyMessage], add_messages]\n",
      "    counter: Annotated[int, operator.add]\n",
      "    data: str  # Uses default reducer (overwrite)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Reducer Functions:\n",
      "**Critical for state evolution** - each state key has an independent reducer function:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Default Reducer**: Overwrites previous values\n",
      "- **Built-in Reducers**: `operator.add` for accumulation, `add_messages` for message handling\n",
      "- **Custom Reducers**: User-defined functions for complex state logic\n",
      "\n",
      "### State Flow Mechanics:\n",
      "1. **Node Execution**: Nodes return partial state updates (not full state)\n",
      "2. **Reducer Application**: Updates applied using specified reducer functions\n",
      "3. **State Persistence**: Automatically saved after each step for resumability\n",
      "4. **Concurrent Handling**: Reducers manage multiple simultaneous updates\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advanced State Features:\n",
      "- **Multiple Schemas**: Support for input/output schemas separate from internal state\n",
      "- **Private State**: Internal node communication channels\n",
      "- **Message Serialization**: Automatic conversion between formats\n",
      "- **State Injection**: Tools can access state via `InjectedState` annotation\n",
      "\n",
      "## 3. Compilation and Execution Process\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compilation Phase:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "graph = graph_builder.compile(\n",
      "    checkpointer=memory,  # For persistence\n",
      "    interrupt_before=[\"human_node\"],  # For human-in-the-loop\n",
      "    interrupt_after=[\"validation_node\"]\n",
      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "**Compilation performs**:\n",
      "- **Structure Validation**: Checks for orphaned nodes, invalid connections\n",
      "- **Runtime Configuration**: Sets up checkpointers, breakpoints, recursion limits\n",
      "- **Optimization**: Prepares execution plan and message routing\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Runtime:\n",
      "- **Super-step Processing**: Discrete execution cycles\n",
      "- **Parallel Execution**: Multiple nodes can execute simultaneously within same super-step\n",
      "- **State Checkpointing**: Automatic state persistence between steps\n",
      "- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery with state rollback capabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Control:\n",
      "- **Recursion Limits**: Maximum super-steps (default: 25)\n",
      "- **Interrupts**: Pause execution at specified nodes\n",
      "- **Streaming**: Real-time execution monitoring\n",
      "- **Configuration**: Runtime parameter injection\n",
      "\n",
      "## 4. Conditional Routing and Loops\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conditional Edge Implementation:\n",
      "```python\n",

      ")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advanced Routing Mechanisms:\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Command Objects:\n",
      "Combine state updates with routing decisions:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def my_node(state: State) -> Command[Literal[\"next_node\"]]:\n",

      "Dynamic routing with custom state for map-reduce patterns:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "def fan_out(state: State):\n",
      "    return [Send(\"process_item\", {\"item\": item}) for item in state[\"items\"]]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Loop Mechanisms:\n",
      "- **Self-loops**: Nodes can route back to themselves\n",
      "- **Conditional Loops**: Continue until condition met\n",
      "- **Bounded Loops**: Recursion limits prevent infinite execution\n",
      "- **Multi-path Loops**: Complex routing through multiple nodes\n",
      "\n",
      "### Routing Strategies:\n",
      "1. **LLM-based Routing**: Use language models for dynamic decisions\n",
      "2. **Rule-based Routing**: Deterministic conditional logic\n",
      "3. **Hybrid Routing**: Combination of LLM and rule-based approaches\n",
      "4. **Tool-based Routing**: Tools that return routing commands\n",
      "\n",
      "### Loop Control Patterns:\n",
      "- **ReAct Loops**: Reasoning-Action cycles until completion\n",
      "- **Validation Loops**: Retry until quality thresholds met\n",
      "- **Human-in-the-loop**: Pause for human intervention\n",
      "- **Multi-agent Handoffs**: Route between specialized agents\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "## What is LangGraph?\n",
      "\n",
      "LangGraph is an open-source AI agent framework developed by LangChain that provides a graph-based architecture for building, deploying, and managing complex generative AI agent workflows. Unlike traditional linear programming approaches, LangGraph models AI workflows as **directed graphs** consisting of nodes (individual components or agents), edges (connections defining execution flow), and a shared state system that persists information across the entire workflow.\n",
      "\n",
      "At its core, LangGraph is a message-passing framework that enables the creation of modular, stateful systems where multiple AI agents can coordinate and collaborate to accomplish sophisticated tasks. The framework represents a paradigm shift from simple chain-based AI applications to sophisticated, stateful agent architectures capable of handling real-world complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Core Problems LangGraph Solves\n",
      "\n",
      "### Stateful Multi-Agent Coordination\n",
      "LangGraph addresses the challenge of building AI systems where multiple agents need to work together while maintaining context and memory across interactions. Traditional approaches struggle with coordinating multiple AI agents that need to share information and build upon each other's work.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Complex Workflow Management\n",
      "The framework excels at managing intricate AI workflows that require cyclical execution patterns (loops and iterations), conditional branching based on AI decision-making, dynamic routing where the AI determines the next step, and long-running processes that need to maintain state.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Beyond Linear Chains\n",
      "While traditional LangChain operates with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that follow a linear sequence, LangGraph explicitly supports loops, branching, and cyclical workflows. This enables true \"agentic state machines\" where an LLM can decide the next node to activate based on current conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Production-Ready Agent Systems\n",
      "LangGraph provides enterprise-grade features including persistent state management across sessions, human-in-the-loop controls and approvals, real-time streaming of agent reasoning and actions, reliability and controllability mechanisms, and built-in monitoring and debugging capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## How LangGraph Works\n",
      "\n",
      "### Graph Architecture\n",
      "LangGraph uses a **directed graph structure** with cyclical capabilities, fundamentally different from traditional DAG-based frameworks. The core components include:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Nodes**: Python functions that encode agent logic, receiving current state as input and returning updated state\n",
      "- **Edges**: Define execution flow and routing between nodes, including normal edges (direct connections), conditional edges (dynamic routing based on state evaluation), and entry/exit points\n",
      "- **StateGraph**: The main graph class parameterized by a user-defined state object\n",
      "\n",
      "### Execution Model\n",
      "LangGraph employs a **message-passing algorithm** inspired by Google's Pregel system, executing in discrete \"super-steps\":\n",
      "1. Nodes begin in `inactive` state\n",
      "2. Become `active` when receiving messages on incoming edges\n",
      "3. Execute function and send updates to next nodes\n",
      "4. Graph terminates when all nodes are `inactive` with no messages in transit\n",
      "\n",
      "### State Management System\n",
      "State can be defined using `TypedDict` or Pydantic `BaseModel` with sophisticated reducer functions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Default Reducer**: Overwrites previous values\n",
      "- **Built-in Reducers**: `operator.add` for accumulation, `add_messages` for message handling\n",
      "- **Custom Reducers**: User-defined functions for complex state logic\n",
      "\n",
      "The state flow mechanics involve nodes returning partial state updates (not full state), reducer application using specified functions, automatic state persistence after each step for resumability, and concurrent handling where reducers manage multiple simultaneous updates.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Compilation and Execution Process\n",
      "The compilation phase performs structure validation, runtime configuration setup, and optimization. The execution runtime features super-step processing, parallel execution capabilities, state checkpointing, and graceful error handling with state rollback capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conditional Routing and Loops\n",
      "LangGraph supports sophisticated routing mechanisms including:\n",
      "- **Command Objects**: Combine state updates with routing decisions\n",
      "- **Send Objects**: Dynamic routing with custom state for map-reduce patterns\n",
      "- **Loop Mechanisms**: Self-loops, conditional loops, bounded loops, and multi-path loops\n",
      "- **Routing Strategies**: LLM-based routing, rule-based routing, hybrid approaches, and tool-based routing\n",
      "\n",
      "## Key Features and Capabilities\n",
      "\n",
      "### Human-in-the-Loop Integration\n",
      "LangGraph provides comprehensive human intervention capabilities with interrupt mechanisms that can pause graph execution at any point, tool call review allowing humans to review and approve actions before execution, input validation systems, indefinite pausing using persistence layers, and resume-from-checkpoint functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Real-Time Streaming\n",
      "The framework supports live streaming of outputs as they are generated, improved user experience through real-time observation of agent actions, progressive results for faster perceived response times, and event-based updates providing real-time state changes and node execution information.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Advanced Memory Management\n",
      "LangGraph implements a dual memory system:\n",
      "- **Short-Term Memory**: Thread-scoped persistence managing conversation context and state continuity\n",
      "- **Long-Term Memory**: Cross-thread memory storage, user profiles, learning from feedback, and structured long-term memory management through the InMemoryStore system\n",
      "\n",
      "### Development and Debugging Tools\n",
      "**LangGraph Studio** serves as a specialized agent IDE providing visual graph editing, real-time debugging with state updates, interactive development capabilities, and node mapping for visual workflow representation. Additional debugging features include state inspection, thread management, execution history tracking, and seamless LangSmith integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Multi-Agent Support\n",
      "The framework enables hierarchical multi-agent systems with agent coordination, supervisor patterns, agent specialization with custom prompts and tools, and collaborative workflows. It also supports swarm intelligence through the LangGraph Multi-Agent Swarm library for collective problem-solving and dynamic agent assignment.\n",
      "\n",

    "## Key Takeaways - OceanBase MCP Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrated the integration of deep agents with OceanBase through MCP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **MCP Integration**: Successfully connected deep agents to OceanBase MCP server at `localhost:8000/sse`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplified Architecture**: Removed unnecessary sub-agents and tools, focusing only on database operations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Database-Specific Instructions**: Customized agent instructions for database schema analysis and querying\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Focused Functionality**: Created a specialized agent for database operations rather than general research\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-time Database Access**: Direct interaction with OceanBase through MCP protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "## Demo Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The demo shows how to:\n",
    "- Connect to OceanBase MCP server\n",
    "- Get table schema information for the 'test' database\n",
    "- Use deep agents for structured database analysis\n",
    "- Maintain workspace files for database findings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "To further explore OceanBase MCP integration with deep agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expand to query multiple databases\n",
    "- Add more complex SQL analysis capabilities\n",
    "- Create database documentation workflows\n",
    "- Integrate with data visualization tools\n",
    "- Build database migration and optimization agents\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of `deepagents` and `langchain-mcp-adapters` provides a powerful foundation for building database-focused AI agents with persistent workspace capabilities."
